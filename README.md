# Function Name: is_divisible_by_x_and_y
The is_divisible_by_x_and_y function takes in three parameters: n, x, and y. It checks if the positive, non-zero number n is divisible by both positive, non-zero numbers x and y. If n is divisible by both x and y, the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

## Syntax
ruby code

def is_divisible_by_x_and_y(n, x, y)

   function code goes here

end

## Parameters
n: A positive, non-zero integer.
x: A positive, non-zero integer.
y: A positive, non-zero integer.
Return Value
A boolean value of true if n is divisible by both x and y, false otherwise.
### Example Usage
rubycode
puts is_divisible_by_x_and_y(10, 2, 5) # Output: true


In the first example, n is 10 and x and y are 2 and 5, respectively. Since 10 is divisible by both 2 and 5, the function returns true.

In the second example, n is 15 and x and y are 3 and 4, respectively. Since 15 is not divisible by both 3 and 4, the function returns false.
